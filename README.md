# Ford GoBike System Data Pipeline, EDA, and Strategic Insights

## Overview

This project explores the Ford GoBike system dataset covering individual ride data in the San Francisco Bay Area. The aim is to uncover how user attributes impact trip durations and to generate actionable insights for enhancing operational efficiency and marketing strategies. Key variables include user type (Subscriber vs. Customer), member gender (Male, Female, Other), and participation in the "bike_share_for_all_trip" program.

## Project Components

- **Data Wrangling & Preliminary Exploration:**  
  Preparation and cleaning of the raw dataset for analysis.

- **Univariate Analysis:**  
  Examination of distributions—for trip durations (on a logarithmic scale), user types, and member genders—to understand the baseline characteristics of the data.

- **Multivariate Exploration:**  
  Investigation of how user attributes (including discount program participation) relate to trip durations. Visual comparisons reveal that customers generally take longer trips than subscribers, and those not enrolled in the "bike_share_for_all_trip" program have longer rides on average.

- **Visualizations & Insights:**  
  Clear, data-driven charts and plots that support the strategic recommendations. Findings from the analysis are intended to inform decisions such as staffing adjustments and the optimization of social media ad channels.

## Usage

For a detailed walk‑through of the methodology, visualizations, and strategic recommendations, please refer to the attached slides. The insights can be used directly to guide fleet management and targeted marketing initiatives.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Required packages: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (or similar libraries for data analysis and visualization)  
- Dataset: Ford GoBike ride data covering the greater San Francisco Bay Area
